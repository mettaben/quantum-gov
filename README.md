## tl;dr
A revolutionary leap into the process of building a more perfect government 2.0

## inspiration

One wonders if the current legacy governments of our day are even capable of rectifying many of their deep dysfunctional aspects. While trying to reform these crufty governments from within is a worthy goal, might it also be a worthy goal to work on a full re-write, much the way like sometimes it is advantageous for  software projects to undergo a complete re-write? 

Consider slavery. From the dawn of the US government, it took the better part of a century before slavery could be abolished, and then even after that was a long period of legal segregation. And of course today we have more blacks in prison than were enslaved before emancipation. Do we *really* have this kind of time to resolve the pressing ethical issues that need to be resolved in order for the human race to reach its full potention?

## just imagine

***Just imagine*** a government that is significantly more nimble in response to ethical issues. But yet not so dynamic that the population suffers needless turbulence. But the balance, overall is more tilted toward change. Big changes. 

***Just imagine*** that a government finds the perfect balance between equality and compassion -- and meritocracy.

***Just imagine*** a government that not only is responsive to the needs of the population, but also intelligent and wise enough to see into the future in order to guide the population into the best possible future.

***Just imagine*** a government that could be built and perfected completely in parallel to the existing legacy governments. 

***Just imagine*** a government that is so well designed that it is naturally attractive to the populations of the world such that they dream about it, think about it, work on it, and someday-- collectively-- they pull the switch and quantum-gov becomes the law of the land, completely replacing old legacy governments.

## the fundamental challenge of democracy

***quantum-gov*** must have a process for how it gets itself built. on the face of it, this is extremely challenging. 

Let's take the bedrock idea of democracy: one person, one vote. And yet with a secret ballot, how does the public independently verify that votes were counted fairly, and that ppl only voted once?

The problem is compounded for a parallel government that can only exist over the internet at the beginning stages of its existence. Verifying the identity of voters is a *huge task* and the potential for fraud is also huge. Yet imagine a rigorous identity sytem, forcing users to upload scanned images of their legacy government identification, and so on. This introduces a huge privacy risk: what if that data somehow got compromised and scanned identification images were stolen for the purpose of committing fraud? 

From the beginning, I think we can see this approach is a non-starter. Can our quantum-gov govern itself somehow without its citizens verifying their identity in order to vote?

## democracy vs meritocracy

imagine if we replace the idea of democracy with the idea of meritocracy, and replace the idea of having to prove identity in order to vote with the idea of strict anonymity? the question is, how do we measure merit, and how can it possibly work in a voting system in which the voters are fully anonymous? So here is the first key idea: what if we were to retire the old democratic idea of one-person, one-vote, and replace it with a new meritocratic idea of **one-hour, one-vote**?

One hour of what? Work. Specifically, unpaid work on the quantum-gov itself. Can work be measured? Sure, if the original form of quantum-gov is that of a internet application, the application can measure its own usage. Just sign into the application with your anonymous id, the timer will count, and if you don't do anything for a while the timer will stop, or if the ai detects that you are doing something repetitive or meaningless, then your time will not count, and you may get investigated.

Investigated? By who? Will the quantum-gov have special officials? Nope, anyone can investigate anyone, and AI will also be constantly investigating. Although you are anonymous, your activity on the application along with your anonymous identity is public. If you are found via a process to be cheating, you will lose your votes, you will lose your valuable history, and your citizen account will be shut down. There is nothing to prevent you from opening a new account, but vote-hours accumulated by accounts with no history will be very closely scrutinized.

Everything you do on the app will be logged, even checking out other ppl's logs. quantum-gov is therefore both fully anonymous and fully transparent. Neat!
